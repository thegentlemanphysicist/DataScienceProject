# Group Project
This is the code repos for the intro to data science group project.

This repo is not tracking zip files.  When you run the code locally it should download the content and generate some folders.

## There are four jupyter lab files in this notebook

### OccupationalUnemploymentRate.ipynb

This notebook was used to generate the plots of unemployment rate with a monthly resolution across the duration of the pandemic.  

### OccupationalUnemploymentRate.ipynb

This notebook was used to gerate the plots and analysis around the the National Occupational Classification (NOC) and sex of the workforce between 2020 and 2019.   

### GroupedOccupationCatagories.ipynb

This notebook experiments with combining NOC's by industry, to show how certain industries impacted to a far greater degree than others.

### MetaDataParsing

This file is mostly a scratch file to extract some of the properties of Occupation classification fields. It was used to attempt to spot reasons for certain NOC's being absent in our raw data.
